jq

===

Today I learned about `jq`, a command line JSON processor. This could be really
useful for interacting with things like the AWS CLI, which spits out JSON from
its API.

jq lets you do some really cool stuff.

For instance, we can pluck the second value from an array:

```
echo "[1, 2, 3]" | jq ".[1]"
// 2
```

Get the value of a more deeply nested structure:

```
echo "{ \"foo\": [1, 2, 3] }" | jq ".foo[2]"
// 3
```

Or map values of an array:

```
echo "[{ \"foo\": 100 }, { \"foo\": \"hello\" }]" | jq "map(.foo)"
// [
//   100,
//   "hello"
// ]
```
