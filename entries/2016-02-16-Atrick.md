A Concurrency Performance Trick
===

The following snippet of code illustrates a trick that:

1. Allows the time that resources are locked to be minimized
2. Avoids space leaks by strictly evaluating concurrent operations.

```
let book_ = Map.insert name number book
putMVar m book_
seq book_ (return ())
```

Very cool! We shove an unevaluated expression into a shared mutable state
container and release the lock on the resource. Immediately afterwards, the
inserted expression is evaluated, avoiding any possible space leaks.

This trick comes from http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/ch07.html#sec_conc-phonebook
