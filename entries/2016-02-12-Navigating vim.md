Navigating vim
===

I'm learning how to get around vim better these days and I learned a few
shortcuts today.

One thing I was really missing was non-single-line or half/full page movement.

`}` and `{` move forward and backward between paragraphs, respectively.

Also, `H`, `M` and `L` moves between the top, middle and bottom of the screen.

These are useful things to keep in mind for moving through the screen without
having to spam `hjkl`
